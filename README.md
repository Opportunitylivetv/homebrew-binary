# Homebrew/binary (deprecated)
These formulae were binary installs of software that, for whatever reason, weren't available as source builds.

This tap was deprecated because [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) handles this use-case better.
All formulae were migrated to [caskroom/homebrew-cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) or other taps.
