# Homebrew Binary (deprecated)
This tap provided binary installs of software that, for whatever reason, weren't available as source builds in the primary repository.

We now recommend using [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) instead.
This will be auto-installed by Homebrew when running `brew cask`.
